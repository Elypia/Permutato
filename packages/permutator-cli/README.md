## About
This is a minimal library/application/website that will allow users to specify a
list of words and it will proceed to generate a dictionary of all possible combinations
of the words in the list with various levels of control based on the settings specified.

This is primiarly intended for generating dictionary files for other tools such
as brute-forcers as input data. One use case could be where one might have an idea for
what words, phrases, or information in the password, but not the combination, order
or capitilization of the words in it.
